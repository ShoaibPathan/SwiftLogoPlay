# SwiftLogoPlay
An exploration of SwiftUI Path animation that started life as a `UIBezierPath` derived from an open-source SVG of the Swift Logo. A fun exploration of the power of SwiftUI animation, using a `CGPointVector` implementing the `VectorArithmetic` protocol.

[See an iPad version in action...](http://fatdog.com/swiftLogoPlay/). Animation is driven by a finger tap. The faster you tap, the more you'll achieve "orbiting vertices".
